                History
                <Br>
                    <br>
                Established in 2020.
                
                The company's history and inspiration was inspired by my daughter Nova, she was a blessing to be born given the conditions her and 
                her mother went through during the Covid pandemic. I had switched jobs several times during the pandemic due to not enough hours or not 
                enough money to survive, I was also layed off one time as well in means to find a career to build a future with the love of my life and 
                our 3 kids (now 4), it seemed like nothing was working so one day I just sat down and thought to asked my self. What can I do in these 
                tuff times? What can I enjoy doing, so it doesn't feel like I'm even working? Then it hit me I started my own 
                business and started small and grew a little more each day little by little, at the same time, our daughter was as well. She learned to
                 talk, she learned to walk and no matter what if she failed, she never gave up. She is my inspiration and drive as well as our family, 
                 so I implemented her name in the business IN NOVA TION - (INNOVATION).

                Hello,
                
                Welcome to Innovation Handy Man Services. My name is Marcello, my company has been serving the Hill Country Area since day one. 
                It also has impacted a lot of people in different ways. I'm proud of my work for others especially seeing the final product in making 
                their vision come true and I also love seeing my customers express there gratification when done. I have been in the industry of many 
                different jobs and could never find something that was different every single day. I created my own company and applied my knowledge, 
                time and effort into making an unforgettable experience and company. There are many great perks to what I have created like creating
                 great friendly relations with my customers and meeting some very great people. I am truly blessed to do what I do.</p>
